# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview

This is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. Players can take turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid, with the goal of getting three in a row. The project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay (X and O).
- Visual feedback with updated board states.
- Alerts for winning players.
- Game resets automatically after a win.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the game interface.
- **CSS**: Styling for the game board and elements.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, including player turns and win checking.

## How It Works

- The game consists of a 3x3 grid where players click on empty squares to place their marks.
- The game keeps track of the moves using a 2D array.
- It checks for winning conditions after each move:
  - Horizontal, vertical, and diagonal checks.
- When a player wins, an alert is displayed, and the game resets.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Click on the squares to play the game.

## Future Enhancements

- Add an AI opponent for single-player mode.
- Implement a scoring system to keep track of wins for each player.
- Improve the design and responsiveness for better user experience.

## License

This project is open-source and available for anyone to use and modify.
